KuraKani is a fantastic, single-person project that brings you a fully open-source and free ChatGPT app for iOS. It all started because I, as the creator, found myself bored and wanted to embark on an exciting new endeavor. The incredible support I received from the community for my previous open-source projects and the cups of coffee bought for me encouraged me to create something truly special.

#### ðŸ¤” Why KuraKani?

*You might wonder, with wayy *too many* ChatGPT apps already available, why add another one to the mix? Well, let's address some common concerns about existing apps:*

**Free and Open-Source:** KuraKani breaks away from the norm by offering a completely free and open-source solution.

**Aesthetically Pleasing:** KuraKani is not just about functionality but also about visual appeal. The app is thoughtfully designed with a friendly interface that enhances your conversation experience.

**Personal API Key:** Use your own API Key.

**Keyboard Extension:** Use KuraKani in any appliations using the keyboard extension.

**Generate Images:** You'll be able to ask GPT to generate images for you.

**Bored:** I was bored.

#### ðŸš€ Future of the App?

**On-Device Models** iOS hardware is highly capable, and if there is enough demand or once I get my hands on the new iPhone, I plan to incorporate support for the Alpaca and LLaMa models. This means increased power and versatility, allowing you to have even more engaging and personalized conversations.

#### ðŸ’µ How are you planning to monetize this app?

**That's the neat part** _i don't_
